  The (Official) Synagogue of Satan is not assosiated with anybody.
  We are a Non-Profit organization openly dedicated to the
  acceptance of Man's true nature—that of a carnal beast, living in a
  cosmos that is indifferent to our existence. The Synagogue of Satan
  is not an initiatory organization. This website is a personal
  website founded on the 9/9/19. The Synagogue of Satan is not to be
  confused with other organizations or groups that have similar names.
