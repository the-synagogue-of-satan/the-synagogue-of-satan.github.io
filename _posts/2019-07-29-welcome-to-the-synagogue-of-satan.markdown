### The Satanist Orgiefesto ðŸ˜ˆ

The Synagogue of Satan is not assosiated with the book with the same name. The Synagogue of Satan is not anti-semitic.

All People, where is it you are going? You are intoxicated; you have drunk up the potent poison of **ignorance**; it has overpowered you and it is time for you to throw it up. Be strong; stand sober; look straight with your eyes at the burning star of Lucifer and the joy in your heart will bring you strength,-not all of you will succeed, only the strong will survive.

This poison floods the whole world; its waves sweeps along the mind which is the soul of man, and prevents it from coming to freedom from false hope. Therefore, realize you are not working on the same level as the rest of the world. Those of you who are the underground elite, and are able to use your higher mind, and find logic, and seek a wise guide to lead you to the Path of Undefiled wisdom.

There you will find the bright light, the light of Lucifer, which comes straight from utter darkness and void; there no fool shall pass, but all who are sober, and look straight to the light of Him whose will it is that the heart alone shall guide all beings, and henceforth their hearts will be filled with joy.

But first you must rid yourself of all hypocritical self-deceit, that cloaks you in darkness, and sheers you with the net of ignorance, this weapon of the righteous, this bond of the pompous and their death-trap, this body of a corpse they call a messiah, this enemy who hates all living being and the nature of the flesh and begrudge you of your desire.

Such is the garment of false hope; and it chains you down, that you may not put up clearly and behold the beauty of the Truth, and the Reason that abides within the higher mind, and hate the hypocrisy of this thing, discovering that they are against you. For it is ridiculous the things they cram into their mildewed minds stuffing it up with bogus morals so that you may not know of true piety nor the things you out to hear of and the things you ought to see.
